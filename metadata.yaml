description: British author Archibald Marshall became a writer later in life and rapidly
  gained acclaim in his own country and abroad. Regarded as a literary realist who
  worked in a vein similar to that mined by Anthony Trollope, Marshall excelled at
  creating sweeping family epics that explore many aspects of society and group dynamics,
  of which Abington Abbey is a stellar example.
